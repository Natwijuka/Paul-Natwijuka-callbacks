# Paul-Natwijuka-callbacks
My application consists of two activities: Activity1 and Activity2. Activity1 is responsible for displaying personal information, including the user's name, registration number, and a photo. Activity2 demonstrates activity callbacks.

In Activity1, the user can enter their personal information such as name, registration number, and upload their photo. Additionally, there is a button provided that allows the user to navigate to Activity2.

Activity2 is designed to showcase the lifecycle events of an activity. Each time a lifecycle callback is triggered, a Toast message is displayed on the screen to inform the user about the current state of the activity.

Overall, the application aims to provide a seamless user experience by allowing users to view and edit personal information in Activity1, and learn about the lifecycle events of activities in Activity2 through Toast messages.
